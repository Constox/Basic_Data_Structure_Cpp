# Basic_Data_Structure_C++
Some implementations of basic data structures like linked list,  queue, stack, tree etc. Some code comes from Leetcode.

## LinkedList
Some data structure concerning linked list.  
### Single Linked List
SingleLinkedList.h is based on single list, it is a linked list with a head node, and a tail node.  
It has been tested on LeetCode, 53/53 test cases passed, and its runtime beats 91.45% of cpp submissions.

## Queue
First in first out(FIFO) data structure.
### Basic Queue
myQueue.h is a simple way to implement queue by using dynamic array(std::vector) and a simple index p_start.  
This code comes from Leetcode and Yongxin add a new function "size()" to show the size of this queue.    
### Circular Queue
It is another way to implement queue. With fixed-size array, it reduces the waste and increase efficiency. 

## To be updated
I'm Keep working on implement more basic data structures.
