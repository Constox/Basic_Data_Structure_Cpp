# Basic_Data_Structure_C++
Some implementations of basic data structures like linked list,  queue, stack, tree etc. Some code comes from Leetcode.

## Queue
MyQueue.h is a simple way to implement Queue by using dynamic array(std::vector) and a simple index p_start.  
This code comes from Leetcode and Yongxin add a new function "size()" to show the size of this queue.   

## To be updated
I'm Keep working on implement more basic data structures.
